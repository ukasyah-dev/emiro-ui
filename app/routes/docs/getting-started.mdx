# Getting started

This library requires that you have a [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) project with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) set up.
If you haven't done so yet, please refer to the official documentation to begin.

To install the library, run:

```bash
pnpm add emiro-ui
```

Update `app/app.css` file:

```css
@import "tailwindcss";
@import "emiro-ui/styles";
```

Update `app/root.tsx` file:

```tsx
import { Provider, REACT_ROUTER_FONT_LINKS } from "emiro-ui";
import "./app.css";

export const links: Route.LinksFunction = () => [...REACT_ROUTER_FONT_LINKS];

export function Layout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <html>
      <body>
        <Provider>{children}</Provider>
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

That's it! You're now ready to build with `emiro-ui`.
